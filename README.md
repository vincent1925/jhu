All the files in the folders + stdpop.18ages.txt are files with the given data. Files too large for GitHub are found in [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CFRAB6wdipsDzCsJT3llI_BiKUcJ36by?usp=sharing) Google Drive folder: 

The setup for the regressions is done in Python in waterquality.qmd and the regressions are done in waterquality_r.qmd. 

The significant results of the regressions are shown in significant_results. significant_results_pop contains the same regressions but includes population as a covariate instead of an offset.
